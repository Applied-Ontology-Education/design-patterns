## Repository Content
This repository contains the following directories:

* **presentations** - Slides for presentations given by participants in the course. 
* **lectures** - Slides for lectures given by the instructor during the course. 

This course provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the rapid creation and application of ontology design patterns. Students will learn to construct modular, reusable patterns and adapt them to various modeling scenarios. Topics include modularity, the distinction between simplified and complex patterns, and displaying patterns in various formats (e.g., PowerPoint, Mermaid.js). The course emphasizes heuristic-driven, practical approaches to pattern design, fostering skills that enable rapid prototyping and iteration.
